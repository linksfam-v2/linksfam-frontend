            content is displayed to users, regardless of whether they interact

            depending on the specific campaign or brand promotion. ‍ ‍
          </p>
          <p>
            ‍ 4.4 The Product Links generated by linksfam are provided for your
            use in promoting products through the Program. It is important to
            note that the validity of these Product Links may be subject to
            certain limitations and conditions. ‍
          </p>
          <p>
            The Product Links generated by linksfam may have an expiration date,
            after which they may no longer be valid for tracking and attributing
            qualifying purchases. It is your responsibility to regularly update
            and replace expired links with active and valid Product Links
            provided by linksfam. The validity of Product Links also depends on
            their proper implementation and usage. You must ensure that the
            Product Links are correctly formatted and placed on your profile or
            promotional channels as specified by linksfam. Failure to properly
            format and implement the links may result in inaccurate tracking and
            attribution of qualifying purchases. linksfam reserves the right to
            determine the validity and effectiveness of the Product Links
            generated. This includes the right to investigate and address any
            issues related to link functionality, tracking accuracy, or other
            technical matters that may affect the proper attribution of
            qualifying purchases. linksfam will make reasonable efforts to
            communicate any changes or updates regarding the validity and usage
            of Product Links. It is your responsibility to stay informed about
            such changes through notifications provided by linksfam or by
            regularly reviewing the linksfam platform or related communications.
            4.5 In the scenario where an end user clicks on the affiliate link
            provided by you, but the session expires or the link becomes
            inactive before they complete the purchase, and the end user
            subsequently directly navigates to the brand site and successfully
            completes the purchase, linksfam shall have no obligation or
            liability for the non-attribution of the qualifying purchase. It is
            understood that unforeseen circumstances, technical limitations, or
            other factors may impact the functionality and duration of the
            affiliate link, and linksfam shall not be held responsible for any
            missed attribution or commission in such cases. It is the
            responsibility of the end user to ensure that the affiliate link is
            properly utilized and that the purchase is completed within a
            reasonable time to ensure proper tracking and attribution. ‍ ‍
          </p>
          <p>5. Payouts ‍ ‍</p>
          <p>
            Payouts for eligible earnings will be processed on a monthly or
            periodic basis within timelines communicated by linksfam from time
            to time. “Eligible earnings” means commissions earnings calculated
            on net order value after deduction of returns or cancellations, if
            any, which have been communicated to linksfam by the brand. linksfam
            will process your payout only after receiving confirmations data
            from the brands. For example, when your audience places an order on
            25th of March amounting to order value of, say INR 5,000/- from a
            linksfam brand say “XYZ” but returns a few items from the order on
            5th April of value INR 2,000/-. Now, supposedly XYZ shares the above
            order data on 15th April, then eligible earnings for this order
            would be calculated on order value of INR 3,000/- and these earnings
            would be considered for the payouts month of April, which would be
            paid in the first week of May, subject to linksfam’s payouts
            processing date. linksfam does not hold any control on the returns
            and cancellations data sent by brands for orders attributed towards
            your earnings. In case you find a discrepancy or not satisfied with
            deductions for returns or cancellations, then you can share your
            concern within 1 month from date of order data reflecting on your
            dashboard. linksfam shall try its best to resolve the concern with
            the brand. linksfam shall not be liable for any delay caused in
            payouts due to delay by brands in sharing the order data. linksfam
            reserves the right to exercise complete veto power over the final
            payouts. In the event that a creator is found engaging in suspicious
            activities, linksfam may withhold or refuse to process their payouts
            without any liability or obligation. Creators who submit an invoice
            and possess a valid Goods and Services Tax (GST) number shall
            provide a valid tax invoice to linksfam. You will raise a valid
            invoice under applicable law(s) and regulations and report it in the
            returns within the prescribed time limit so that linksfam can take
            input tax credit of the taxes paid. You undertake to comply with any
            of the applicable provisions of such law including but not limited
            to: Timely issuance of GST compliant invoices; making the invoices
            available to linksfam; depositing applicable taxes on a periodic
            basis; and correctly reporting them to the government under tax
            laws. ‍

          <p>6. Tax Obligation and Indemnification: ‍</p>
          <p>
            If at any time the credit of taxes is denied or the payment of taxes
            is sought from linksfam due to reasons including, but not limited
            to, the issuance of a deficient invoice, default in tax payment,
            inappropriate reporting in the filed returns, or non-compliance with
            applicable laws and regulations by you, you shall indemnify linksfam
            against any denied credits, recovered taxes, interest, and penalties
            imposed on linksfam. If required by applicable Indian Tax Law,
            linksfam may deduct or withhold taxes, levies, or similar amounts
            from the advertising fees payable to you. If you are an Indian
            resident, the advertising fees payable to you will be subject to
            income tax withholding at the rate stipulated under applicable law.
            linksfam will deduct or withhold taxes as per the provisions of the
            Income Tax Act from any amounts payable to you under this Program.
            For payment processing and tax remittance purposes, linksfam may
            periodically request tax information from you. In the event that you
            do not provide the required tax information, we reserve the right,
            in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us, to keep
            your fees in abeyance until you provide the necessary tax
            information or satisfy us that you are not a person from whom we are
            required to obtain tax information If you are not an Indian resident
            or have not provided us with your PAN (Permanent Account Number),
            the rate of tax withholding applicable to you will vary.
            Furthermore, if you are a non-resident, you agree to provide
            necessary documentation, as may be required, for linksfam to fulfill
            any reporting or obligations pertaining to the advertising fee
            payable to you. If we deduct or withhold taxes from advertising fees
            payable to you, we will issue the relevant withholding tax
            certificate, if required under applicable law, as evidence of the
            tax deposit with the relevant regulatory authorities (for
            non-residents, this is subject to the availability of relevant
            documents). If you provide us with a nil or reduced withholding tax
            certificate, we will apply the applicable nil or reduced tax rate as
            the withholding tax rate on advertising fees payable to you. By
            accepting this SLA, you agree not to pursue any claims against
            linksfam or any of its affiliates and hereby waive all such claims,
            now or in the future, with respect to any taxes deposited by
            linksfam with the relevant taxing authority in accordance with this
            SLA. ‍
